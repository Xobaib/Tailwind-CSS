# Tailwind CSS
### Build a CSS Tailwind Landing Page with [Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFgzHOX84xQ)

- we have been built a complete responsive website where we have used most common tailwind utility classes
- this wbsite is one of the [front-end mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/manage-landing-page-SLXqC6P5) projects or challenges
- we have also used some custom css classes like **css animation** and **media query** and little bit of javascript for hamburger menu that appears on mobile design
